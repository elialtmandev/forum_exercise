This is the Forum One "Drupal Coding Exercise" module.  When enabled
it will provide a 'Forum Exercise' block to be placed in the region
of your choosing.

The block will show the current logged in user's username, last
logged in time and date, a link to their profile and an optional
plain-text message.

Instructions:

1. Install the module
2. Under "Block layout" (admin/structure/block), click 'Place Block'
   on a region of your choosing (suggest 'Sidebar first').
3. Click 'Place Block' next to the available "Forum Exercise" block.
4. Click 'Save block'.

[optional] When editing the block, you can optionally add a plain
text message to be shown at the bottom of the block, visible to
all authenticated users.
